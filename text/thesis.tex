\chapter{Introduction}
File systems remain an important part of modern storage solutions. Large, growing databases, multimedia and other storage based applications need to be supported by high-performing infrastructure layer of storing and retrieving information. Such infrastructure have to be provided by the operating systems (OS) in a form of file system.




\chapter{Related work}
\label{related}
In this chapter I present different approaches of file system aging and fragmentation research described and implemented in the past. The first section discuss usage of collected data to create aging workload. The second section discuss possibilities of aging the file system artificially, without pre-collected data.

\section{Aging file system using real-life data}


\chapter{File system and storage devices}
\label{fs}
In this chapter, I present basic information about used file systems, storage devices and its features relevant to performance and aging.
